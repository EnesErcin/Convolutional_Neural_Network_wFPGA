This module has huge deficiency such as:
-Only works when Second Input has higher exponent (Easy Fix)
-Probably wont work when exponents are equal (Easy Fix)
-Code should be cleared and organaized (Delete the unnecesery parts)

I stoped wasting time on this module as soon as I felt ready to 
implement real digital design on Verilog.

For some reason it took me so long to finally comprehend
the IEEE-754 Standart floating point arithmatic.
