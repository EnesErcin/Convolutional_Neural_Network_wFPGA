Since the main purpose of this repository is to build convulutional
nerual network hardware it felt unappropirate to use someone elses
floating point arithmatic unit because one simple mistake may cause
catastrophic results.Imageine if this design later expaned to used
in ai soldiers who shoots the enemy and protects the childeren. One
decimal after floating point in first layer may confuse the ai.

Jokes asside It would be impossible to debug at higher levels.
In addition since I want to build more advanced stuff in  future 
I felt the neccesity to build my own IEEE-754 standart floating
point arithmatic unit.
